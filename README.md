# Collision detection MVP

Minimal codebase to visualize and simulate continuous collision detection.

## Requirements

* Python3
* Pip3
* PyYAML - `pip3 install pyyaml`
* Panda3D - `pip3 install panda3d`

## Usage

To run the client:

1) `cd ./aeonsplice/`
2) `python3 client.py`

The client currently accepts `.yaml` files with appropriate formatting. There is
currently little-to-no input validation, as this is just a quick and dirty
proof-of-concept.
